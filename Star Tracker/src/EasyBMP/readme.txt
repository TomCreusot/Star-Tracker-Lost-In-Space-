THIS IS NOT MY CODE, it was copied from:
http://easybmp.sourceforge.net/


The purpose for this is only as a way of testing the functionality of the
blob detection and can be discarded afterwards.

Some I have applied some modifications to aid with testing:
	EasyBMP_DataStructures.h:
		Changed RGBApixel to a class instead of a struct and added the function brightness();
